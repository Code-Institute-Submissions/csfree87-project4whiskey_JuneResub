Welcome,

This is a website designed to present users with the option of booking a reservation. 

Due to time constraints after multiple issues getting through depoloyment both in the module instructions as well as during the project development, this site is incomplete. It is missing a finished readme.file, user story project issues (user story agile tool was made on previous repository, lost after having to rebuild project), proper commits and comments throughout, as well as a functioning booking system. 

I am submitting this, as is, to have feedback on what is available prior to resubmission. 

Database set up via Heroku postgres as instructed via Code Institute I Think Therefore I Blog.
